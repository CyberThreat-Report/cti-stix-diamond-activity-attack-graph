# cti-stix-diamond-activity-attack-graph

This is an Open Source tool for visualizing [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html)
2.1 content in an Attack and Activity Thread graph by applying
[The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf)
methodology and attack phases from the [MITRE ATT&CK v8.2](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.

The tool is implemented in the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) framework. The complete visualization
is built with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), a Javascript library for document manipulation, and all is processed in the
browser without requiring a server (backend).

## Quick access

To get a quick demo about the functionalities of the tool visit
https://yukh1402.github.io/cti-stix-diamond-activity-attack-graph/ and load following example
[JSON](https://github.com/yukh1402/cti-stix-diamond-activity-attack-graph/tree/main/example/example-bundle.json)
into the platform.

In order to deploy your own application instance we recommend a docker container. The docker
[image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/1402/cti-stix-diamond-activity-attack-graph) is available on Docker
Hub.

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 1402/cti-stix-diamond-activity-attack-graph:latest
```

## Graph types

STIX objects can be easily visualized by providing a STIX 2.1 Bundle. Depending on the graph selection STIX information
will be displayed in an Attack or Activity Thread Graph. An Attack Graph is timeless and shows multiple TTPs (
techniques, tactics and procedures) in MITRE phases. The Activity Thread Graph takes the time into account and generates
a correlated time/TTP graph. By selecting a TTP a Sub-Graph will appear with all the related STIX objects.

## How to use the tool?

The STIX Bundle needs to have a structured schema with several Grouping SDOs. All objects that are related or in the
same context will be referenced in the `` "object_refs" ``Â´ field of the associated Grouping SDO.

For providing a valid STIX Bundle schema that can be processed in the application 3 requirements are necessary:

1. Each Grouping SDO needs to have one Attack Pattern SDO reference. The Attack Pattern SDO schema is derived from the
   MITRE ATT&CK framework and can be found on the
   [MITRE CTI](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/enterprise-attack/attack-pattern) repository or pulled from the
   [MITRE ATT&CK TAXII Server](https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#access-from-the-attck-taxii-server).

        "description": "Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.",

2. All STIX objects which are considered in the same context belong into one Grouping SDO. The references of these
   objects will be registered in the `` "object_refs" `` field of the Grouping SDO. STIX relationship objects (SRO)
   that are in the same context are registered in the `` "object_refs" `` field as well.
